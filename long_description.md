This application enables the creation of a high quality 3D model of an archaeological artefact via process known as 
photo-masking. There has been a revolution in 3D modelling in recent years and it is now relatively easy to construct 
such models from ordinary digital photographs. Isolating the object depicted in these photographs, and masking out the 
background, is an important first step to achieving high quality results. The final 3D model will be made publicly 
available and is useful not only for basic documentation purposes, but also for graphical displays in museums, for 
inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments, or for identifying different sub-styles in otherwise similar 
types of artefact (that might tell us about the date of the artefact, where it was made, or by whom).

This particular photo-masking application is an experiment as we are attempting to model a bell from the Mary Rose shipwreck after the bell underwent conservation work.

### What we want you to do

We would like people to draw a polygon around the object that they see in each photograph in order to identify its 
outline and exclude the image background. This allows the 3D modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and 
ignore irrelevant background information.

If you are interested in what our 3D completed models look like, please have a look [at our Sketchfab profile](https://sketchfab.com/micropasts).
