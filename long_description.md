This application enables the creation of a high quality 3D model of an archaeological artefact via process known as 
photo-masking. There has been a revolution in 3D modelling in recent years and it is now relatively easy to construct 
such models from ordinary digital photographs. Isolating the object depicted in these photographs, and masking out the 
background, is an important first step to achieving high quality results. The final 3D model will be made publicly 
available and is useful not only for basic documentation purposes, but also for graphical displays in museums, for 
inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments, or for identifying different sub-styles in otherwise similar 
types of artefact (that might tell us about the date of the artefact, where it was made, or by whom).

This particular photo-masking application is an experiment as we are attempting to model a bell from HMS Hood after the bell underwent conservation work.

HMS Hood was a British Battle Cruiser that was sunk on 24th May 1941 by the German Battleship Bismarck during the Battle of the Denmark Strait. In 2001 the wreck was located by Blue Water Recoveries with the shipâ€™s bell found lying on the seabed away from the hull. Paul G. Allen (co-founder of Microsoft) led an expedition supported by Blue Water Recoveries, in August 2015 to retrieve the bell and soon afterwards it was sent to Mary Rose Archaeological Services for conservation. The bell was presented to the HMS Hood when she was launched in 1918, by the widow of Rear-Admiral Sir Horace Hood, great-great grandson of Sir Samuel Hood after whom the ship was named. Sir Horace died at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, one of 1,026 officers and men who died in seconds when the battlecruiser HMS Invincible blew up and sank, and the bell is inscribed to that effect. The bell of the HMS Hood is now on display in a new exhibition 36 Hours: Jutland 1916, The Battle That Won The War at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. The bell has been installed as a memorial to the 1,415 men who lost their lives when the ship sunk in 1941. These photos of the bell post-conservation show the condition the bell was in just before it was put on display within the 36 Hours exhibition. Only the outside of the bell was photographed.

### What we want you to do

We would like people to draw a polygon around the object that they see in each photograph in order to identify its 
outline and exclude the image background. This allows the 3D modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and 
ignore irrelevant background information.
